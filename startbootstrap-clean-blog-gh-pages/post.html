                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">

                        <p>I was 16 years old when I became a river guide on the Middle Fork and Main Salmon rivers. Because I was still under age, my responsibility was to transport all the equipment, because this didn't involve me having guests (liabilities) on my boat. Instead, I transported a much less talkative, and much more heavy payload that resembled 3000lb, moving bed and breakfast.
                            After an already exhausting 90 miles down the Middle-Fork of the Salmon, I met 6 fellow river guides at the Main Salmon put-in. There I was to "run gear" for a group of 28 guests the next morning.</p>
                        <p>About 10 miles down river, I caught up with a fellow gear runner for another team. Squinting my eyes, I saw him bent over tinkering on his 10 horsepower motor. As I drew closer, the horizon of Devils Tooth Rapid appeared.
                            To my dismay, this fellow boatman failed to get far enough right to avoid a house side rock that most of the river converged into. As this 24' J-Rig smashed into the rock, its left pontoon scraped up this devilish boulder, and there I saw my friend-- riding the opposite pontoon like a helpless cowboy, before took a deadly swim under a spiderweb of camping gear.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let me tell you, OH CRAP were not the first words to come out of my- until then- innocent mouth. And when I came to, I realized that I too was heading for that same trap. And if I wanted any chance of keeping my job, I needed to get much farther right. After greasing the rapid I had a passenger I was traing dock the boat at camp (which convienently was right below the rapid.)</p>
                        <p> In an attempt to catch up with this floating booby trap, I ran 4 miles down some of the most (as my grandpa would say) asenine terrain I had ever encountered. After taking multiple plunges into boulder fields, poisen ivy, and thorn bushes, I finally reached my friend, who, when I last saw him was riding on the top of his upsidown lump of rubber. In the meantime, I managed to rescue a guitar,
                            multiple tables, chairs, first aid supplies, and guest bags from eddie pools in the river. </p>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Moments after encountering the J-Rig</span>
                        <p> That night our camp looked much less like a high-class camping experience, and more like a refuge camp. 60 guests were crammed on the beach, with their soaking posessions creatively hung on oars, straps and trees. After eavesdropping on a heated satelite phone call with my boss, I overheard the words I dreaded most: "Someone is going to have to run to the boat ramp early tomorrow morning to retrieve 
                            emergency supplies." Before I became volunteered (everyone knew I was an Ultra Runner), I decided to take one for the team.
                        </p> 
                        <p>There I went, another 13 miles uphill in this same asenine terrain. When I reached the boatramp,  my boss waited with a replacement boat that would help us evacuate our guests downriver. The catch was, we also had to limp down our totaled J-Rig down another 80 miles of whitewater</p>
                        <p>Experiences like these have helped me learn how to operate under pressure, develope critical decision making skills, and build character.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summer 2022</h2>
                        <p>Most people spend their summers stretched out on beaches, traveling the world, or at a summer internship. Like prior summers, I planned to spend mine knocking doors selling pest control and solar. Days before the strenuous drive across the country to Bridgewater NJ, I was hit by a car while riding my bike home from campus. 
                            Lukily, after my head went through the windshield, and an unintentional backflip that could've qualified me for the olympics, I landed somewhat upright 15 feet behind the car. After a trip to the ER, a concussion, broken foot, and missing finals, the show went on. Less than 2 weeks later, I was stumbling up a doorstep in crutches about to pitch 
                            my first customer of the summer.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">I had made a goal at the beginning of the year to sell over $300,000 in personal revenue, and nothing was going to stop me.</blockquote>
                        <p>Knocking doors on crutches was about as effective as it sounds, but after I recovered I began to build momentum. By the end of July I was just under $200,000. With less than a month left, it was go-time. My momentum was interrupted yet again when an exposed wire in the street wrapped around my segway tire and sent me overboard. After assesing the damage,
                            I walked away with only some bumps and bruises... Until persistent pain lead to an X-Ray, lead to an MRI, lead to the discovery of a broken wrist.  </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Nothing worth doing was ever achieved without effort.</blockquote>
                        <p>I persisted. Knocking doors with a cast. I wasn't able to achieve my revenue goals by the first day off BYU, but I was too close to give up- especially after all I'd been through. All it took was a few seconds of courage to book a plane ticket to San Diego, and an online class schedule to work with to bridge the $50,000 gap to help me reach my goal.
                            After gaining some momentum in San Diego, my sales streak was interupted yet again. After knocking a door, I heard what sounded like a monster growl from behind. The 3" thick door of protection was an illusion. To my horror I saw out of the corner of my eye a 100 pound pitbull sprinting towards me from an open garage. 
                            Knowing that running would only worsen my case, I stood my ground-- trying not to expose any limbs to this slobbery nightmare. Unfortunately, I left some of my "vitals" explosed and the dog bit me too far down south to talk about publicly. </p>
                            <p>The owner, a complete jerk, offered me no remedies. After a trip to a local restaurant bathroom, and a call to a urologist, I was able to get back on the doors (after a couple days). I ended up ahcieving my goal, selling my last account after 8:30pm, after it had been dark for multiple hours allready. From this experience, I learned persistence and grit. 
                            Sometimes we are not dealt the right hand in life, and where there is a will, you bet there's a way.</p> <br>

                        <p>Gratefully, my life is full of experiences like this. Experiences that cause you to pause, learn, take a deep breath, and LIVE!
